## Who are we, and what we do?
We, [API Development](https://www.api-development.co), aim to create a better world through innovation and technology. Therefore, we must constantly strive to research and develop new technologies. 

## Why Research
Research 🧑‍🔬 allows you to pursue your interests, learn something new 🙌, hone your problem-solving skills, and challenge yourself in new ways. Working on a faculty-initiated research project will enable you to work closely with a mentor–a faculty member or other experienced researcher. So do we!
We love research like you love your mother & father 👩‍❤️‍👨.

## What research are we working on?
We work in many fields of technology, such as Deep Learning & NLP 🤖, Some of them we have to keep secret 🤫 but don't worry! We will publish our research as soon as possible!😆
